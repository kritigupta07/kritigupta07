### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science and a love for building applications that make a difference.

I enjoy working across technologies — from mobile development to machine learning — and I constantly strive to enhance my understanding of **core CS concepts like Operating Systems and DBMS**. Problem-solving through **Data Structures and Algorithms** is something I practice regularly to keep my skills sharp.

- 🔭 Currently building **Clyra**, a hospital management system for doctors & patients  
- 🤖 Created **Wake Wave**, a drowsiness detection app using OpenCV + CNN  
- 📚 Regularly explore and revise **OS, DBMS, CN**, and system design fundamentals  
- 💡 Love solving **DSA problems** on platforms like LeetCode & GFG  
- 🌱 Learning: **Deep Learning, RAG systems, Generative AI, System Design**  
- 🧠 Curious about user experience, AI agents, and scalable architecture
